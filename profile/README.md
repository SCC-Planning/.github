## SCC Planning ðŸ‘‹

This is a Github reposity for the Planning team within Suffolk County Council. This page was set up to share code and make our work accessible to other local authorities. Hopefully it is useful for others.

### Styling and template packages
There are two packages in this organisation that guide developers with styling and templates, [sccthemes](https://github.com/thomaszwagerman/sccthemes) and [scctemplate](https://github.com/SCC-Planning/scctemplate).

Most styling is also discussed in the [SCC Cookbook](https://github.com/SCC-Planning/scc-cookbook) (work in progress!).
